birthday_paradox
================

Simulation that tries to make the birthday paradox more intuitive.

This is a interactive simulation that tries build an intuition in the user while it checks 
how many shots one usually tries before seeing a collision. For more information about the 
birthday paradox check this [wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem).

Its was done with JQuery and html5 canvas. This is my first javascript program so don't be suprised if it looks strange.
